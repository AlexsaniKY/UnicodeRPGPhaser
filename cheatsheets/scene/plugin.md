## :ballot_box_with_check: Plugin

In case of doubt, the [official source code](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) should be accessed.

### Introduction

The Scene Plugin is one of the seven core plugins.
It is installed into every scene and you can access it with `this.scene`.

We will inspect here only some of the members and functions. Consult the official [ScenePlugin.js](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/blob/master/src/scene/ScenePlugin.js)
to find all the members and functions to access.

### Control your scene

You will have to know how to control your scenes. If you want for example to
start a scene from another scene, you can use `this.scene.start('newScene')`.
